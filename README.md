# ShelfSpace : Books Shop Management System
This project was created only with the scope of school project by using MySQL and Python only:


In this project modules used are:

1. smtplib (for sending emails)

2. mysql.connector (for connection to MySQL Server)

3. fpdf (to autogenerate pdf invoices)

4. validate_email (to validate emails of users on sign up)

5. time (to register the order time)

6. string (for string formatting)

7. datetime (for calculating date differences)

### Key Features:

- This code consists of approximately 1400 lines and it has every function that a bookshop owner requires.

- It helps new users to register themselves and order/return/replace/check details of order/view details of book, etc.

- Every time a new user sign up, his/her email is validated that if it exists.

- On placing order, user gets a thanks message and an autogenerated PDF invoice on his/her email address given during sign up. (see invoices folder)

- Every time a user return/replace/cancel order, he/she will receive an auto generated email.

- Administrator has all the rights of viewing, updating, deleting users (not passwords), and also can view/cancel/replace/return orders of a specific user.

- Errors are handled very seriously in this whole project.

### Drawbacks:

- The only drawback is that no GUI has been used, therefore everything happens in the shell itself. However, real time databases are used and emails are send.
